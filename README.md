# Portfolio
This will have all updates to my personal website hosted to vgvenkataraman.com
#### Want to just checkout the code?
- clone project
- `$ cd Portfolio`
- run a simple python server ` $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
- checkout the simple css files and js files in the dist folder. `Index.html` reads from the dist folder.
- The css and js files are concated by unminified files for easier reading.

For messing around the project,

#### Steps to run code
- clone project
- `$ cd Portfolio`
- `$ grunt` for running server

grunt file can be repurposed in a better way, holds good for now.
